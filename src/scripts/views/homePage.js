						<p> One thing veterans lose when re-entering civilian life is the camaraderie of having a shared experience with other individuals. H.O.W. connects veterans who are going through the court process together so they can share their experiences, stories, and most importantly, get help when they need it. The Veterans Treatment Court model requires regular court appearances, mandatory attendance at treatment sessions, and frequent and random testing for substance abuse. Without the VTC, these veterans are at a higher risk to reoffend and remain in the criminal justice system. H.O.W. ensures they meet their obligations to themselves, the court, and their community. We hope that by providing an avenue for veterans to walk down together, they will get through the court system without issue and come out with an improved support group on the other side.
